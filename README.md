# dbInator
 dbInator is a python library which allows anyone to create, update and look at data from any sqlite3 database.

 ## Installation
 To install from command line:
 git clone https://github.com/Melon-Bowl/db-management-system.git

 Or you can download the zip file.

 Make sure that all the files are in the same directory when running main.py

 ## Usage
 Simply run the main.py file and follow the instructions in the terminal 😁

 Please note that if you are creating a new database, it will be created in the same directory as main.py. If you are using an existing datbase, make sure that it is also in the same directory as main.py

 ## Roadmap
 I am currently working on templates for new entities and letting the user make thier own from scratch. Currently, all entities will contain the pre-set columns --> ProductID, Name and Price

 ## Contributing
 External contributions are currently closed as I am working on this as a personal project.
